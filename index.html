            <h1 class="text-center">Education</h1>
         <p>I study Computer Science and Informatics at UMass Amherst. I also have a minor in math since I am interested in data science. I plan to graduate in May 2024, but am considering grad school. Some of my favorite CICS courses include web development, software engineering, algorithms, and social issues in computing. This fall I will be taking Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Make: An Hands-On Introduction to Physical Computing.</p>

            <h4 class="text-center">Work Experience</h4>
            <p>This summer I'm interning with MathWorks as part of their Engineering Development Group (EDG). I'm excited to help them with their products including MatLab and Simulink, which help researchers in academia and industry solve important problems. This is my first official internship so check back later this summer for updates!</p>

        <div class="section" id="skills-section">
            <h4 class="text-center">Skills</h4>
            <p>I've been learning Python ever since I started at CICS. I've also started learning Java and C in classes. For side projects and hackathons I enjoy iOS development using Swift. Outside of programming languages, I'm also familiar with Agile Development, UI/UX, and cloud technologies like AWS. For data analytics, I'm experienced with Tableau and Excel and am learning PyTorch and TensorFlow. In terms of professional skills, I am known for being very organized and I really enjoy writing, as you can see!</p>
